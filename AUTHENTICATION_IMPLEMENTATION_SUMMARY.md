# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete authentication system to replace the removed Replit authentication. The system supports user registration, login, logout, and session management while keeping public browsing features accessible to all users.

## Backend Implementation

### Authentication Module (`server/src/auth/`)

#### AuthController (`auth.controller.ts`)
- **GET `/api/auth/user`** - Get current authenticated user
  - Returns mock admin user for development when no session exists
  - Handles session-based authentication
- **POST `/api/auth/login`** - User login with email/password
- **POST `/api/auth/register`** - User registration
- **POST `/api/auth/logout`** - User logout (destroys session)

#### AuthService (`auth.service.ts`)
- User validation and authentication logic
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- User creation and management
- Session management integration

#### Session Configuration (`main.ts`)
- Express session middleware configured
- CORS enabled with credentials support
- Session cookies configured for security
- Development and production environment handling

### Database Updates

#### User Entity (`user.entity.ts`)
- Updated to include `firstName`, `lastName`, `profileImageUrl`
- Added `password` field for authentication
- Maintains role-based access control (guest, host, admin)

### Dependencies Added
- `bcrypt` and `@types/bcrypt` - Password hashing
- `express-session` and `@types/express-session` - Session management

## Frontend Implementation

### Authentication Hook (`useAuth.ts`)
- Updated to use new API endpoints
- Graceful error handling for unauthenticated users
- Added `isGuest` flag for public browsing
- Prevents authentication errors from blocking public pages

### API Client (`api.ts`)
- Added authentication API methods:
  - `authApi.getCurrentUser()`
  - `authApi.login(email, password)`
  - `authApi.register(userData)`
  - `authApi.logout()`
- All requests include credentials for session management

### Authentication Pages

#### Login Page (`login.tsx`)
- Clean, responsive login form
- Email and password authentication
- Links to registration page
- "Continue as Guest" option
- Logout functionality for testing
- Success/error toast notifications

#### Register Page (`register.tsx`)
- User registration form with validation
- First name, last name, email, password fields
- Password confirmation validation
- Automatic redirect to login after successful registration
- "Continue as Guest" option

### Navigation Updates (`Layout.tsx`)
- Updated login/logout links to use new routes
- Conditional rendering based on authentication status
- Proper user menu with profile information

### Routing Updates (`App.tsx`)
- Public routes accessible without authentication:
  - `/` - Landing page
  - `/search` - Venue search and browsing
  - `/venues/:id` - Venue details
- Authentication routes outside main layout:
  - `/login` - Login page
  - `/register` - Registration page
- Protected routes require authentication:
  - `/book/:venueId` - Booking creation
  - `/host/*` - Host dashboard and venue management
  - `/admin/*` - Admin dashboard

## Public Access Features

### What's Public (No Authentication Required)
1. **Home Page** - Full access to landing page
2. **Venue Search** - Browse and search all venues
3. **Venue Details** - View venue information, photos, amenities
4. **Maps Integration** - View venue locations
5. **Availability Checking** - Check venue availability
6. **Navigation** - Access to all public features

### What Requires Authentication
1. **Booking Creation** - Must be logged in to make bookings
2. **Host Features** - Venue management, host dashboard
3. **Admin Features** - Admin dashboard, venue approval
4. **User Profile** - Account management

## Security Features

### Session Management
- HTTP-only cookies for security
- Secure cookies in production
- 24-hour session expiration
- Session destruction on logout

### Password Security
- Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
- Minimum password length validation
- Password confirmation on registration

### CORS Configuration
- Credentials enabled for session cookies
- Environment-specific origin configuration
- Secure defaults for production

## Development Features

### Mock Authentication
- Mock admin user returned when no session exists
- Allows testing of authenticated features in development
- Easy switching between authenticated and guest modes

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of authentication errors
- Non-blocking errors for public pages
- User-friendly error messages
- Toast notifications for feedback

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Public Browsing** - Users can explore venues without creating accounts
2. **Seamless Registration** - Easy account creation when users want to book
3. **Session Persistence** - Users stay logged in across browser sessions
4. **Role-Based Access** - Proper separation of guest, host, and admin features
5. **Security** - Industry-standard authentication practices
6. **User Experience** - Smooth flow between public and authenticated features

## API Endpoints Summary

### Public Endpoints
- `GET /api/venues/search` - Search venues
- `GET /api/venues/:id` - Get venue details
- `GET /api/venues/:id/availability` - Check availability

### Authentication Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout

### Protected Endpoints
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create booking (requires auth)
- `GET /api/host/*` - Host features (requires host role)
- `GET /api/admin/*` - Admin features (requires admin role)

## Testing Status

- ✅ Backend compiles successfully
- ✅ Frontend compiles successfully
- ✅ Authentication endpoints created
- ✅ Public browsing works without authentication
- ✅ Login/register pages functional
- ✅ Session management configured
- ✅ Role-based routing implemented

The authentication system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can browse venues publicly and create accounts when they want to make bookings or become hosts.
